# NLP-Quora-Insincere-Questions-Classification
Overview

Description: This NLP project aims to classify Quora questions as either sincere or insincere. It uses machine learning and natural language processing techniques to identify and flag insincere or potentially harmful questions on the platform.



Python 3.x
Libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow)
Jupyter Notebook (for running the project)
Other necessary libraries and tools
Installation Steps:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quora-insincere-questions.git
Install Python and required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt

Model Architecture: A simple feedforward neural network with multiple fully connected layers. It takes an input with 1000 features and uses the ReLU activation function between each layer, with a single output unit. This architecture is suitable for a wide range of NLP classification tasks.

Training: 
To train the FeedForwardModel

Define the model architecture with four linear layers.
Forward input data through the layers with ReLU activations.
Train the model to minimize the loss.
Adjust hyperparameters as needed (e.g., learning rate, batch size).
Evaluate the model's performance on validation data.

Model Performance: accuracy, F1-score
